    <ul>Ingredients&colon;
        <!-- each item in the list is marked with <li -->
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <!-- sol is short for solidus, a fancy name for slash -->
        <li>3&sol;4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3&sol;4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 &amp; 1&sol;4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1&sol;2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>

    <!-- <ol>, ordered list, works like <ul>, only items are automatically numbered rather than bulleted -->
    <ol>Steps&colon;
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
